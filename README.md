# Automatic-Grading-system
Using CNN model, this project evaluates user's descriptive answers and provides a corresponding rating. The dataset contains a collection of descriptive QnA set.

Abstract:
Manual grading of student answer scripts can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies due to factors like fatigue and personal biases. In response, our project introduces an automated grading system powered by machine learning algorithms. It streamlines the evaluation process by extracting and analyzing textual data from answer scripts. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model, it learns features from the text, allowing for accurate rating predictions. Additionally, the system leverages cosine similarity to identify top-N similar answers, providing educators with a comprehensive view of student performance. By significantly reducing the grading workload, this project empowers teachers and professors to focus on other vital aspects of education, such as personalized student feedback and lesson planning. The system's performance is quantitatively assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) on a test dataset, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.
